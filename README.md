Abstract from the Publication:
Skipjack, yellowfin, and bigeye tuna sustain large commercial fisheries, particularly in the western and central Pacific ocean (WCPO), a region which supplies over half of the worldâ€™s tuna. Recent advances in molecular techniques have pointed to fine-scale population structure within each of these species, in some cases challenging current spatial management delineations. We investigate the demographic histories and population structure of 361 skipjack, yellowfin, and bigeye tuna in the central Pacific using 2bRAD sequencing of a combination fisheries-independent samples of tuna larvae and subadults collected by the Secretariat of the Pacific Community Tagging Program. Demographic information corresponded well to established population dynamics, and evidence of population structuring was seen in yellowfin (but not skipjack or bigeye), raising questions surrounding the stock structure of the species. Future work should leverage whole genome sequencing of tuna early life history stages collected throughout the Pacific to resolve the degree of tuna population structuring within the broader WCPO and better inform spatial management.
